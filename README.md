** 🎯 U.S. States Guessing Game **

Welcome to the U.S. States Guessing Game! 
🗺️ Think you know your states? Prove it! 
This Python game will test your geography skills while making you feel like a true explorer 
(or reminding you that you need to revisit grade school maps).



** 🕹️ How to Play **

Launch the Game: Run the Python script and watch the U.S. map pop up.

Guess the State: Type the name of a U.S. state when prompted. (Spelling matters, my friend!)

Get Rewarded! If you're right, the state name will appear on the map in its proper location. 
If you're wrong, well... you'll get a gentle reminder to try again. 😅

Win the Game: Guess all 50 states correctly! Or... type Exit if you need to escape (no judgment).

See What You Missed: Once you're done, a file called missed_states.csv will be created with the states you couldn't remember. Study up for next time!



**🛠️ Technologies Used **

Python 🐍 (the friendly kind, not the venomous one)

Pandas (for handling the state data like a pro)

Turtle Graphics (for the visual magic)



🎯 Why I Created This

I built this project as part of my learning journey to master Python and get comfortable with Git. 
This is my first time sharing code on GitHub, so be kind—or roast me gently. 😉

This game was crafted not only for fun but to help me learn how to:

Work with CSV data

Use the Turtle library for graphics

Practice version control with Git


🚀 Try it Out!
